Forelsning 3 notes

_____________
UML
General purpose visual modelling language
Specify, visualize, construct and document the artifacts of a software system
Decisions and understanding about systems must be constructed. 
Information to explain to upper management why the system needs certain information.
Diagrams shows what services in our systems are doing.

____________
Is it a standard?
The UML specification does not define a standard process.
UML is not a programming language but can be used to write programs.
For GUI-layout, VLSI circuit design, or rule based artificial intelligence.
Communication tool between different languages/different systems.

_______________
Is it enforced?
No
Developed to simplify the methods.
Developed to unify the concepts.

__________________
UML HISTORY
Its not perfect.
Future maintenance is easier
Unity between different systems/languages
Its good for planning and visualizing the code
Blueprint for the code
Quick understanding.
System handover

UML DIAGRAMS
14 types of diagrams
Structural diagrams will show you the structure. (here is a table, next to the tables are chairs)
Behavioural diagrams show the systems behaviour.
The different diagrams allow to see different aspects of the same system.
show different behaviours of the same system.

______________________________________
Structural UML diagram (what is in it)
Class diagram
This is the most used diagram used in the industry.

Behavioural UML diagrams (how it behaves)
Use diagram
Activity diagram
Sequence diagram

_________________________________________________________________________________________
The UML is a modelling language, not a description of a detailed development process.
UML is a different way to look at the code it isn’t the code in boxes and arrows.
UML has several kind of models, not something to master in a semester.

______________________
Complexity of UML
A lack of clarity in understanding could be confusing.
Classes can become convoluted when put in a uml diagram. One entire page just for one class.
UML is a product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests. It shares qualities of the product of the democratic process.
It is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will.
It contains superfluous features but some might disagree.
It contains overlapping features that aren’t always well integrated. It lacks a consistent viewpoint.
It has narrow usage. From business modelling to graphical programming.
There is tension between concepts for conceptual modelling and programming language representation. With no consistent guidelines.
There is no single right way to use it.
UML is more than visual notation. UML models can be used to generate code and test cases.



____EKSTRA NOTES_________
100 hour coding project – its uml diagram takes around 300 hours
Starting with UML diagram will give some sort of guidance for the coding.
The professor suggested starting with the Diagram first.
(Are there standardized software? Yes, it is dependent on the Risk. What happens if the software fails.)
(don’t forget the legend on the diagram)

Analysis and design
Identify objects(Figuring out what the program needs to work properly)
define relationships
establish interface
Making design executable
