## What is object oriented programming?

Object oriented programming is a concept in which you program.
Data and Objects. 
The idea is if we have a piece of data, how can we manipulate that data within the object. with oop we can keep the upper part and manipulate the bottom part.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

Manipulating the data rather than writing the code itself. How do i want to manipulate this piece of data.
Advantages of oop is code reusability and it is easy to troubleshoot. It is also more flexible and is good for effienceny. 
It also allows for scalability.

## What are the main principles of OOP?

abstractions, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is "Bundling" You can bundle together things that belong together. A car has a engine, wheels and a steering wheel. 
They all go under the class "Car".
there are 3 types of encapsulation: Public, private and protected. 
you can narrow it down to the example that you are allowed to play with this, but not that. 
Meaning that if youre working with steering wheel, you are not allowed to manipulate the data that belongs to engine.
another word for encapsulation is data hiding. 
We should use encapsulation to make sure other people accessing the data dont manipulate it/change it.
Security, data hiding, simplicity, aestetics are the fundamental reasons.


## Abstraction

Abstraction means that you only have access to key information or required information. The background information is hidden or not accessible. If you ride an elevator, you know pressing the open door button opens the door. You dont know what the mechanism has to do to actually open it.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a process where new classes are created from already exsisting classes. Properties are derived from the Base class and given to the "child class"

## Polymorphism


Polymorphism is when something is the same, but has different forms. A person in a company can be an employee and the boss for others.
